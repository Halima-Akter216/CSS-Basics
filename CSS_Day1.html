    <h1 style="color:red; font-size:30px">This is for CSS</h1>
    <p>To customize the text color we have color property
        And for font customizing we need font-size property.
    </p>
    <p>For aligning text we have text-align</p>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;color:green">Hey People!</h1>
    <p>There are 3 types of css styling.1.inline,2.internal,3.external
        <br />If we want to style individually,we need inline which means for each line.
        <br />If we want to style multiple line at a time we need internal or embedded which should be
        written in the head section..

    </p>
    <h2>This is for internal or embedded styling.</h2>
    <h2>This is also for..</h2>
    <p>We also can customize specific line in internal styling. For this we need class selector.
       And here we use dot(.)
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-editor">This is for class selector</h3>
    <h3>This is also for class selector.</h3>
    <h3>This is too.</h3>
    <p>We also have id selector. For id selector we use #</p>
    <h1>This line is for id selector testing</h1>
    <h1 id="idS">This is also for testing purpose.</h1>
    <p>In professional code there are only one id selector should be used in one page.
        There are 2 types of selector. 1. class selector,2.id selector.
        <br />If we want to change the full background of whole page then we need to target the BodySection.
        <br />For commentout line or silent line we use the buttons(control,k,c)at a time.
        <br />If we want to use image as background we need background-image property.
        <br />If we want to set the position of image then we  need background-position property.
        <br />If we need to fix our background while scrolling,then we need to write background-attachment fixed.
